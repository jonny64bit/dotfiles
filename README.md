# 👽 Jonny64bit dotfiles! 🍰

This is an attempt to keep my dotfiles, install scripts & settings in sync across multiple machines.

The idea being that I can run the setup script on a new machine and have it setup the way I like it.

I admit though this has spawned into a bit of a monster, but I'm having fun with it. 🤖
